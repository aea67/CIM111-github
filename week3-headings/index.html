  <h1>All About Ag</h1>
    <p>Hi. My name is Agnes, and I'm from Texas. I am a student at the University of Miami, majoring in Creative Advertising, with Interactive Media and Art as minors. This website was made for one of my interactive media classes. Being an advertising major meant I was learning graphic design concepts and the practical application of it-advertising. As a creative, it's basically in my job description to be inspired. That is the ultimate state of pure positive potential, and it's where a lot of the best ideas come from. , I use my design and advertising skills to change the script. I'm not just an advertising student, I am a design hacker. I want to use my skills to influence the world for the better.
